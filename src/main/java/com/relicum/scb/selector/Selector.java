     * Closes this resource, relinquishing any underlying resources. This method is invoked automatically on objects
     * managed by the {@code try}-with-resources statement.
     * <p/>
     * <p>While this interface method is declared to throw {@code Exception}, implementers are <em>strongly</em>
     * encouraged to declare concrete implementations of the {@code close} method to throw more specific exceptions, or
     * to throw no exception at all if the close operation cannot fail.
     * <p/>
     * <p><em>Implementers of this interface are also strongly advised to not have the {@code close} method throw {@link
     * InterruptedException}.</em>
     * <p/>
     * This exception interacts with a thread's interrupted status, and runtime misbehavior is likely to occur if an
     * {@code InterruptedException} is {@linkplain Throwable#addSuppressed suppressed}.
     * <p/>
     * More generally, if it would cause problems for an exception to be suppressed, the {@code AutoCloseable.close}
     * method should not throw it.
     * <p/>
     * <p>Note that unlike the {@link java.io.Closeable#close close} method of {@link java.io.Closeable}, this {@code
     * close} method is <em>not</em> required to be idempotent.  In other words, calling this {@code close} method more
     * than once may have some visible side effect, unlike {@code Closeable.close} which is required to have no effect
     * if called more than once.
     * <p/>
     * However, implementers of this interface are strongly encouraged to make their {@code close} methods idempotent.
